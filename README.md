# Small-scale-solar-power-generation-using-MATLAB
> A MATLAB Simulink-based mini project that models and simulates a small-scale solar power generation system. This project was developed during my 2nd year of ECE to understand solar panel behavior, energy conversion, and basic renewable energy system simulation.
